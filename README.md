All credits go to the ReVanced Team for the ReVanced patches. I simply compile builds and release them here for convinience, please do not file issues because I will not be able to solve them.

NOTE: - These builds can NOT be installed alongside any other build of YT ReVanced since the package name is NOT unique to my builds. This means that you will have to uninstall any other version of Spotify you have installed before installing this.

Remember the best way to get the ReVanced apks are to compile them yourself, but if you are unable to do that yourself, you can use my builds. I use the manager and compile as soon as new updates become available, but this process elicits implicit trust. 

Finally, under no circumstance do I mean to not credit the original authors of the patches, integrations and the manager [ReVanced Team](https://github.com/ReVanced) who have put in their hardwork to establish this pipeline for the masses. My goal is to provide the builds in good faith for people who are unable to do so themselves as I had been privately doing for friends and family already.
